<!-- Overview -->

## Overview
**Salla Core JS** package is based on the Event-Driven Architecture, which is a modern design approach centered on data that represents "events" (i.e., a product has been added to the cart). In event-driven programming, an event is the result of a single or multiple actions. Subscribers can listen to that event and take action after it is released by the emitter.


## Getting Started
**Salla Core JS** uses [EventEmitter2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventemitter2), which is an implementation of the [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter) module found in Node.js. It not only outperforms EventEmitter in benchmarks and is browser-compatible, but it also adds a slew of new non-breaking functionality to the EventEmitter interface.



### Installation 
**Salla Core JS** can be installed from the `npm` using the following commands:

```npm title="NPM Installation Command"
npm install @salla.sa/base --save
```

```yarn title="Yarn Installation Command"
yarn add @salla.sa/base
```

### What's included?
A quick look at the top-level files in the **Salla Core JS** project:

```
.
├── src / helpers
├── src / config.js
├── src / cookie.js
├── src / event.js
├── src / index.js
├── src / logger.js
└── src / storage.js
```

## Usage

```js
import Salla from "@salla.sa/base"
```

Upon the installation, the following will be available to the developer:

### Confiruration
When the JS Core project is first loaded, the initialization procedure is used to obtain the necessary configuration settings. The developer has the ability to configure the project to meet his needs.

### Helpers
The JS Core project is packaged with a variety of helpful functions that may be accessed and used directly within projects. 

### Storage
Developers can use local storage to save and retrieve data in the browser. The data in local storage does not have an expiration date. This means that even if the tab or browser window is closed, the data will remain. Furthermore, the data is only saved locally. 

### Cookies
The JS Core project makes it easy to create, retrieve, and modify cookies. Name, value, and length can be limited.

###  Logger
The JS Core project includes a logger tool that helps in tracking the execution flow and determining why certain things occur in the JS application.

### Events
The Events can be triggered by the emitter's 'emit()' method. This method causes the event to be pushed using the data that the developer has provided.

For example, the developer may create an event based on verified login by the user. Simply, the  `emit()`  method can be called with a list of parameters. These parameters state the event's action and the passed data along with it as below:

```js
// via event name
Salla.event.emit("auth::verified",  {success:  true},  'email')
```

#### Listening to the event 

After creating the event along with its list of data, the next step is to implement an appropriate listener for that event. In  **Salla JS Events**, this can be achieved using two methods:

- Using the event name and result directly along with an anonymized function to perform the needed action based on the event result.
```js
// via event name
Salla.event.on('auth::verified',(response, authType)  =>  {
// lets do anything when the event emit
console.log('The customer has been verifed');
console.log(response, authType)
});
``` 
- Adding a  `one`  time listener for the event along with an anonymized function to perform the needed action based on the event result.
```js
// Adds a one time listener for the event.
Salla.event.once('auth::verified',(response, authType)  =>  {
// The listener is invoked only the first time
// the event is fired, after which it is removed.
console.log('The customer has been verifed');
console.log(response, authType)
})
```
