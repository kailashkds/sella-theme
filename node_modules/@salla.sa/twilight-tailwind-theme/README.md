## Overview
The Tailwind-Theme Plugin registers the styles needed by the [Twilight Web Components](https://github.com/SallaApp/twilight-components) and then injects them into the theme stylesheet using JavaScript instead of CSS. It can also be used as a starter theme for any theme based on [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
  
## Usage 
By default, any [Tailwind-based](https://tailwindcss.com/) theme will look for the `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of the project to retrieve any pre-settings and customizations. Accordingly, the plugin Tailwind-Theme should be added to the `tailwind.config.js` file as follows:

```js
plugins: [
  ...
  require('@salla.sa/twilight-tailwind-theme'),
  ....
]
```

### JIT Enabled

**Tailwind** added a [just-in-time compiler](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode), which generates styles as the developer writes the theme rather than generating everything in advance at initial build time. Since JIT mode generates your CSS on-demand by scanning your template files, it’s crucial that the developer configure the `content` option in the `tailwind.config.js` file with all of the theme paths, otherwise the CSS classes will be empty.


```js title="tailwind.config.js"
...
content: [
  // theme views
  "views/**/*.twig",
  // list of classes which required by twilight web components
  "node_modules/@salla.sa/twilight-tailwind-theme/safe-list-css.txt"
],
...
```

 ## Add a New Component

 With Tailwind, developer style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly into the HTML. This is done using utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS. Based on that, the developer may develop a new component by simple doing the following steps: 

 1. Create a new folder with the name of the new compnenet.
 2. Create a `utilities.json` file with list of new compnenet's classes as json.
 
## Publish 
Last, the developer may publish the project using the following command:
```
npm run publish
```
